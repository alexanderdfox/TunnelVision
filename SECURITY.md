# 🔐 SECURITY.md — Dual-VPN AND Logic Network Trust System

## 🛡️ Security Overview

This system implements a **redundant trust verification model** where internet data is only accepted if **two independent VPN tunnels** deliver **identical responses**.

Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on a **single point of trust**, this system uses logical **AND verification** across separate network paths, substantially increasing resistance to common attack vectors.

## 🔍 Threat Model

| Threat                          | Mitigation (AND Logic)                             |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Malicious VPN exit node         | Requires compromise of **both** VPNs simultaneously |
| DNS spoofing                    | Mismatched resolutions = rejection                 |
| HTTPS tampering (SSL stripping) | TLS mismatch triggers discard                      |
| Local MITM (e.g., public WiFi)  | Secondary VPN path protects integrity              |
| BGP hijacking                   | Route-based divergence leads to detection          |
| Compromised ISP or national firewall | VPN-level encryption and response comparison   |
| Geo-IP deception (spoofing)     | Conflicting results can alert or reject            |

## 🧠 Trust Principle

> "Only trust the internet when **two isolated channels** agree."

This system relies on:
- **Independent VPN routing**
- **Cryptographic response hashing**
- **Logic gates (AND, OR, XOR)** to determine acceptance criteria

---

## 🛰️ Protection Against BGP Hijacking

- By routing traffic through **two geographically and topologically distinct VPNs**, BGP hijacks on one path are unlikely to affect both.
- Data from each tunnel is independently hashed and compared.
- **Mismatches are treated as tampering or route poisoning** and rejected.

---

## 📦 Integrity Checks

Every HTTP/S request or DNS query is:
1. Sent through both tunnels in parallel.
2. Responses are hashed (e.g., SHA-256).
3. If hashes match → Trust.
4. If not → Reject + optionally alert.

---

## 🔐 VPN Selection Recommendations

- Choose VPNs with:
  - Separate **ASNs (Autonomous System Numbers)**
  - Diverse geopolitical jurisdictions
  - Proven **RPKI/BGP validation support**
  - Non-overlapping infrastructure and DNS

Example Pair:
- ProtonVPN (EU)
- Mullvad (SE) via tethered phone or WiFi

---

## 🧪 Validation Logic (Default = AND)

You may switch between logic gates:
- `AND` — trust only if both responses match
- `XOR` — detect anomalies between paths
- `OR` — allow if either path is clean
- `NAND` — raise flags on perfect match (used for honeypots)

## ⚖️ Trade-offs

| Advantage                        | Cost                                  |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| High resistance to spoofing      | Increased latency (parallel lookups)  |
| No single point of trust         | Requires setup of 2 VPN tunnels       |
| Tamper-detection across paths    | Slight performance impact             |
| BGP-aware sanity checking        | More complex network routing          |

---

## 🚨 What This Does NOT Guarantee

- It doesn’t prevent attacks **if both VPNs are identically compromised**
- It doesn’t verify **application-layer payload authenticity** (e.g., JavaScript injection)
- It does not encrypt data **between client and remote target**, only via VPNs

For deeper security, combine this with:
- Content signing
- TLS fingerprint validation
- Secure enclaves or sandboxed runtime environments

---

## 🧩 Future Security Enhancements

- Add 3-path consensus (2-of-3 trusted votes)
- Integrate DNSSEC and DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS) trust anchors
- Use blockchain-stored content hashes for verification
- Implement honeypot mode to attract and log active MITM attacks

## 📘 Summary

This project provides **a novel form of network-based cryptographic trust**, rejecting any content not verified through **logical consistency across independent paths**.

It is designed for users, researchers, and defenders who understand:
> In a world of compromised routers and spoofed DNS, trust must be earned — and verified in parallel.
